My research interest focuses generally on analyzing and understanding health and mortality levels and trends. I am a big R fan and enjoy causal coding and data vizualisation. Further, the methodological challanges of measuring health and mortality caught my interest. This webpage includes mainly information on my research but I might also post about not work-related topics.
